# Data Analysis with Pandas

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts focused on data analysis using the Pandas library in Python. It is aimed at beginners and intermediate-level learners who want to get hands-on experience with data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.

## Table of Contents

1. **Introduction to Pandas**
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
3. **Data Transformation**
4. **Data Aggregation and Grouping**
5. **Merging and Joining DataFrames**
6. **Data Visualization with Pandas**
7. **Case Studies and Example Datasets**
8. **Advanced Pandas Techniques**

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into multiple files, each demonstrating specific data analysis techniques. Here is a brief description of each file:

- `01_Introduction_to_Pandas.ipynb` - Basic introduction to Pandas, covering DataFrame and Series creation, data selection, and basic operations.
- `02_Data_Cleaning_and_Preprocessing.ipynb` - Techniques for handling missing data, dealing with duplicates, and basic data cleaning steps.
- `03_Data_Transformation.ipynb` - Data transformation techniques, including filtering, sorting, and reshaping data.
- `04_Data_Aggregation_and_Grouping.ipynb` - How to group data and perform aggregation functions like sum, mean, and count.
- `05_Merging_and_Joining_DataFrames.ipynb` - Methods for combining datasets using merge, join, and concatenate.
- `06_Data_Visualization_with_Pandas.ipynb` - Visualization of data directly using Pandas, including line plots, bar charts, histograms, etc.
- `Case_Studies` - Folder containing specific case studies, each focused on solving real-world data problems using Pandas.

## Getting Started

To get started with the notebooks in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JahaganapathiSugumar/Data_Analysis_With_Pandas.git
   cd Data_Analysis_With_Pandas
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas jupyter matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. **Run Jupyter Notebook**

   Launch Jupyter Notebook to access the files:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open the Notebooks**

   Navigate through the files and explore the different aspects of data analysis with Pandas.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and viewing the notebooks.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For visualizations.

## Usage

Each notebook is designed to be self-contained, allowing you to run and modify the code for a better understanding of each concept. Some of the examples require sample datasets, which are included within the repository. 

## Contributing
